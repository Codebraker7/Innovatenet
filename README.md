Online integrated platform for projects taken up by the students of various universities/colleges

## Problem Statement

Innovation is the key to betterment of education and students in the Indian universities/colleges put a lot of efforts on the projects as a part of the academic requirements. If a common knowledge platform (with a facility for plagiarism) is created to bring all project works taken up at various levels by the students in Technical / Higher Educational Institutes and Universities throughout the country, then it will be a great source of knowledge and also will help the student community to take up unique/innovative project works Summary: An integrated platform should be developed where in all the universities/Colleges provide information about the projects done by the students. The information on this platform will help in the peer learning and this will also help in cross functional research between various universities/colleges. Objective: To develop an online integrated platform for projects taken up by the students of various universities/colleges.
